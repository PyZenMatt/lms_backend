## 💰 **HOW TEACHERS EARN STAKING TEO**

### **Primary TEO Sources:**
1. **Student Discount Absorption**: When students use TEO discounts, teachers get TEO
2. **Performance Bonuses**: High-rated courses earn bonus TEO
3. **Platform Milestones**: Course sales targets = TEO rewards
4. **Initial Seeding**: New teachers get starter TEO package

### **Student Discount → Teacher TEO Conversion:**
```
Student uses 40 TEO for €20 discount:
├── Student saves: €20
├── Teacher absorbs: €20 cost
├── Teacher receives: 50 TEO (125% compensation!)
└── Platform covers: TEO minting cost
```

---

## 🔄 **CIRCULAR TOKEN ECONOMY**

### **The Beautiful Cycle:**
1. **Students earn TEO** from course purchases/completion
2. **Students spend TEO** for discounts on courses
3. **Teachers absorb discount cost** but receive 125% TEO compensation
4. **Teachers stake TEO** to reduce platform fees
5. **Higher margins** → better courses → more students → more TEO

### **Platform Benefits:**
- **TEO circulation** creates platform stickiness
- **Teacher retention** through staking rewards
- **Student loyalty** through discount system
- **Sustainable economics** without losing platform revenue
