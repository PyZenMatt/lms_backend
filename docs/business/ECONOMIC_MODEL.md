## 💰 Platform Commission Structure

### Core Economics
| Component | Percentage | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Platform Commission** | **25-50%** | Variable based on teacher staking tier |
| **Teacher Payout** | **50-75%** | Progressive rewards through TeoCoin staking |
| **Payment Processing** | ~3% | Stripe fees (deducted from platform share) |
| **TeoCoin Rewards Pool** | 5% of platform commission | Funds student rewards |
| **Platform Net Margin** | ~20-45% | After processing fees and rewards |

### Example: €100 Course Sale (Diamond Teacher)
```
Course Price: €100
├── Teacher Receives: €75.00 (75% with Diamond staking)
├── Platform Commission: €25.00 (25% with Diamond staking)
    ├── Stripe Fee: €3.00 (3%)
    ├── TeoCoin Rewards: €1.25 (5% of commission)
    └── Platform Net: €20.75 (20.75%)

Student pays: €100
Platform keeps: €20.75 net
Teacher progression: Bronze (50%) → Diamond (75%)
```
